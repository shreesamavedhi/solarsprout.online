## Project Overview

I created this quick comic strip back in high school, as a way to practice and improve my pencil drawing skills. Coincidentally, some of the ideas for this comic- mainly a wizard using cards to cast spells- have stuck with me all these years, and became incorporated in one of my more recent projects. Check out my [Wizard Wars Game](/2024/12/30/wizard-wars.html) to see how these concepts evolved!
