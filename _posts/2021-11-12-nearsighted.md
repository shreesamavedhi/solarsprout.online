## Project Overview

The eye and the leaf in this drawing are similar in lots of ways. Obviously they share a shape and 'eye'; yet, the rain transforms into tears because of what the eye chooses to see. The tragedy and misfortune spreads through the river to others who drink from its' reservoir. 

The idea for the drawing came from observing social media and online recommendation algorithms at the time. People were targeted with content plagued of fear and anger, with the sole purpose of propagating this sentiment to the greater community. I found the negative outlook to be polluting online spaces.
