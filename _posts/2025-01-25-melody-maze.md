## Project Overview

Melody Maze is an innovative puzzle game that combines musical composition with spatial problem-solving. Players navigate through maze-like levels where each movement creates musical notes, ultimately composing a melody as they solve the puzzle. The game explores the intersection of music theory, puzzle design, and interactive audio.

## Game Mechanics

The core gameplay revolves around these key mechanics:

- Each tile in the maze corresponds to a specific musical note
- Player movement creates a sequence of notes that forms a melody
- Puzzles are solved by creating specific melodic patterns
- Special tiles modify notes with effects like reverb, delay, or pitch-shifting
- Completed levels can be exported as musical compositions

## Development Process

Melody Maze was developed over a six-month period using Unity. The project required close collaboration between game design, music composition, and programming to create a system where gameplay and music generation were seamlessly integrated. Custom audio middleware was developed to handle the procedural music generation based on player actions.

## Visual Design

The visual aesthetic combines minimalist geometric patterns with music visualization elements. The environment responds visually to the music being created, with colors, shapes, and particle effects that react dynamically to the notes being played. This creates a synesthetic experience where visual and audio elements enhance each other.

## Educational Value

Beyond entertainment, Melody Maze serves as an interactive introduction to music theory concepts. Players intuitively learn about scales, chord progressions, and melodic structures as they progress through increasingly complex puzzles. The game includes an optional "theory mode" that explains the musical concepts being utilized in each level.

## Player Reception

Early playtesting has shown that Melody Maze appeals to both music enthusiasts and puzzle game fans. Players particularly enjoy the satisfaction of hearing their solution transform into a pleasing musical composition, creating a reward system that goes beyond traditional puzzle game achievements.
