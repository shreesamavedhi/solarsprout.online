## Project Overview

This character animation study explores the nuances of emotional expression through subtle movements. The project focused on creating believable character reactions using principles of anticipation, follow-through, and secondary motion.

## Process

The animation was created using a combination of traditional frame-by-frame techniques and digital tools. I began with rough sketches to establish the key poses, then refined the movement through careful timing and spacing adjustments.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the biggest challenges was conveying complex emotions through minimal facial movements. I solved this by focusing on the eyes and subtle shifts in posture, which helped create a more nuanced performance without overanimating.

## Outcome

The final animation successfully demonstrates how small, deliberate movements can convey complex emotional states. This project helped me refine my understanding of character acting in animation and timing for emotional impact.
