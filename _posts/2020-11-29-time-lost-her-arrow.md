## Project Overview

For most of my works, I'd consider myself a gardener artist-- laying down a foundation and building onto it piece by piece. This drawing is no exception. What started out as a few notably large features (a large smiling face and a few flying butterflies) evolved into an enriching landscape of detail. 

My favorite elements of this piece: 
1. The falling dice- what was only a few options morphs into an incalculably random chance
2. The phrase "it's not the answer", completed by "you're looking for", in an unexpected location. Conveys the idea that we can never know for certain what will benefit us in the choices we make. 
3. The road that leads to nowhere- a spinning circle disjoint from the pieces of land at the bottom and floating in the horizon. Combined with the phrase I mentioned earlier, this again makes you think about how we may perceive life through the lens of choices that may not be the ones that actually matter.
