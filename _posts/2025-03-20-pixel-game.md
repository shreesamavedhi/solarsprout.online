## Project Overview

Pixel Adventure is a retro-inspired platformer that combines classic gameplay mechanics with modern design sensibilities. The game features hand-crafted pixel art, responsive controls, and a charming world filled with secrets to discover.

## Development Process

The game was developed over a three-month period using a custom game engine. I created all the pixel art assets, designed the levels, and programmed the game mechanics. The focus was on creating tight, responsive controls and satisfying platforming challenges.

## Art Style

The visual style draws inspiration from 16-bit era games while incorporating modern lighting effects and animation techniques. Each environment was designed with a distinct color palette to create visual variety throughout the game.

## Gameplay Features

- Fluid character movement with precise jump controls
- Multiple unique environments with different gameplay mechanics
- Hidden collectibles and secret areas
- Original chiptune soundtrack
- Boss battles that test different skills

## Reception

The game was featured in several indie game showcases and received positive feedback for its tight controls and charming art style. Players particularly enjoyed the hidden secrets and the satisfying platforming mechanics.
