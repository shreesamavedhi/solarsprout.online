      <h2>Hello, I'm Shree</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Solar Sprout! I'm Shree Samavedhi, a multidisciplinary artist and creator passionate about bringing ideas to life through various creative mediums. What started as casual experimentation with different art forms has blossomed into a lifelong journey of creative exploration.</p>
      
      <p>By day, I work in tech, but by night (and weekends!), I transform into Solar Sproutâ€”composing music, filming videos, developing indie games, and crafting both digital and traditional art. I believe that creativity flourishes when it's allowed to cross boundaries between different mediums and disciplines.</p>
      
      <p>This site serves as both a portfolio of my work and a blog where I share my creative process, tutorials, and thoughts on art and technology. Whether you're a fellow creator looking for inspiration or simply curious about my work, I hope you'll find something here that resonates with you.</p>
