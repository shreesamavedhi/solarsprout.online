  Hi, I'm Shree Samavedhi, but you can call me Solar Sprout! I'm a multidisciplinary artist exploring the intersections of animation, game development, music composition, filmmaking, and visual arts.
  
  By day I work in tech, but my nights and weekends are dedicated to creative pursuits. This site serves as both a portfolio of my work and a blog where I share my creative process, tutorials, and thoughts on art and technology.
